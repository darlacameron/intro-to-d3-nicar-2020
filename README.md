# Introduction to D3 at NICAR 2020

Bring your data to life with elegant and intelligent visualizations with the D3 JavaScript library. We'll start with some Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) basics and learn what makes the D3 library so powerful, then use real-world datasets to build your first D3 chart. We will build on D3 basics by exploring more complex chart forms, covering functions for fetching and manipulating data, and introducing transitions and interaction. We will write working code together, break down how some of our favorite examples of D3 charts work and practice reading documentation so you can gain expertise on your own.

Prerequisites: Attendees should have some knowledge of HTML/CSS and JavaScript. Previous D3 experience is not required.

Instructors: [Darla Cameron](https://www.texastribune.org/about/staff/darla-cameron/) from the Texas Tribune and [John Muyskens](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/john-muyskens/) from the Washington Post

## Thanks for joining us today!

#### What is [D3](https://d3js.org/)?
- While we often use D3 to make charts, it is not technically a charting library!
- D3 is a JavaScript framework for manipulating documents and the DOM with data
- The 3 Ds stand for **Data Driven Documents**

#### When should you use D3?
- Techy graphics teams used to use D3 for every chart, but we've learned better. In our newsrooms, we try to limit D3 usage to when we need to be extra creative with visualization shape, do fancy transitions or update a graphic regularly. For example:
	- The Washington Post's [police shootings database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/), which includes lots of dynamic charts and updates annually.
	- The Washington Post's [coronavirus tracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/01/22/mapping-spread-new-coronavirus/?arc404=true), a dynamic map which was updated multiple times per day during the outbreak.
	- The Texas Tribune's [migration tracker](https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2019/migrant-texas-border-trump-policies/), which updates monthly and has dynamic charts. 
	- The Texas Tribune's [political district competitiveness index](https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2019/texas-turn-blue-voting-pattern-history/), where charts form an interactive narrative.
- If you want to make a basic chart or map for the web that *doesn’t* need to be interactive, be republished regularly or use a crazy shape, we highly recommend good ol’ Adobe Illustrator + [ai2html](http://ai2html.org/) or [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/)

#### What we're going to learn today
- First, what do **you** want to learn? Have any of you tried to learn D3 and gotten stuck? We hope you leave here today:
	- Knowing basic D3 terminology and concepts
	- With a foundation for getting yourself un-stuck when you inevitably run into something that doesn't work as expected.
- We will have you work through each of the exercises in this repository in pairs. Introduce yourself to your neighbor! 
- Here's how **pair programming** works:
	- One person types the code and the other has documentation open, telling the typer what to do next. 
	- Why pair program? Most errors are typos, and this saves you from swapping between documentation and the code.
- We have 3 hours and 30 minutes together, and we'll take a bathroom break in the middle of the session. Feel free to get up and stretch whenever you need to.
